# TODO

## Ideas
- left side navigation of hierarchy on wiki page
  - collapsible on mobile
- page title on nav (?)
- differentiate quests into sidequests and mainquests
- sections
  - Questlog (personal, team)
  - Showing only upper pages on home page
  - player chars
  - items of note
  - Organizations
  - Rule changes -> Mechanics
  - Maps
  - Cards instead of list with images
- add sketches/maps to quests

## Problems

# Done
- favicon
- look for nice hero images
- home page displays weird on mobile
